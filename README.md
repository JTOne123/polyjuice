You can use Fakers to build `Address`, `Bank`, `Company`, `Conference`, `Country`, `DateAndTime`, `Gender`, `Geolocation`, `Identification`, `Internet`, `Job`, `Locale`, `Name`, `Phone`, `Price`, `Product` and `Vehicle` attributes.

```csharp

var person = new Person
{
    FirstName = Name.FirstName,
    LastName = Name.LastName,
    FullName = Name.FullName ,
    NameWithPrefix = Name.NameWithPrefix,
    Gender = Gender.Random,
    Birthday = DateAndTime.Birthday 
};


var account = new BankAccount
{
    CardNumber = Bank.CardNumber,
    CardExpiryDate = Bank.CardExpiryDate,
    CardType = Bank.CardType,
    Iban = Bank.Iban()
};
